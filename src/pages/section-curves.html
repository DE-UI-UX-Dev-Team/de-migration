                    You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how
                    your browser displays various HTML elements by default.
                    It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML
                    format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>
                <p>This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that
                    the set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected
                    those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules,
                    in my opionion.</p>
